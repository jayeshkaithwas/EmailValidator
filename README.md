   # EmailValidator

   **EmailValidator** is a Python script that checks the validity of an email address through multiple verification steps. This script helps ensure that an email address is properly formatted, belongs to a valid domain, and actually exists.

   ## Features

   - **Email Format Validation**: Ensures the email address is in the correct format.
   - **Domain Validation**: Verifies that the domain name is valid and not from a disposable email provider.
   - **MX Record Check**: Retrieves and checks the domain's MX (Mail Exchange) records.
   - **Mailbox Verification**: Attempts to connect to the email server to verify the existence of the email address.

   ## Installation

   Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EmailValidator.git
   cd EmailValidator
   ```

   Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   ## Usage

   You can run the script from the command line:

   ```bash
   python email_validator.py example@example.com
   ```

   Replace `example@example.com` with the email address you want to validate.

   ## How It Works

   The script follows these steps to validate an email address:

   1. **Check for Email Format**: Uses a regular expression to ensure the email address is formatted correctly.
   2. **Validate Domain**: Checks if the domain name is valid and not from a known disposable email provider.
   3. **Check MX Records**: Resolves the MX records for the domain.
   4. **Simulate Email Delivery**: Connects to the email server and simulates sending an email to verify if the email address exists.

   ## Example

   ```bash
   python email_validator.py user@example.com
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   Valid email address
   ```
